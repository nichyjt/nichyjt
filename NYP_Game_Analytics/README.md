# Game Analytics

## Synopsis
This project was done back in 2015 in the NYP-NCHS Science and Technology Research Programme.  
Essentially, we got various data parameters off of Osu!'s player profile pages, analysed the data to get some findings, and gave recommendations based on the findings.
Python & Jupyter Notebook IDE was used for this project.

## Area for Improvement
Reviewing the research process 5 years after the project ended, there are a few things I would have done to improve this project.

1. Getting the data more efficiently.
    - Back then, the data was recorded manually and pseudo-randomly chosen from the playerlist using a RNG.
    - If done today, I would utilise a **screen scraper** to get the data. We could've gotten a bigger sample size if we had done this.
2. Analysing the data
    - The mathematics in this project was not sophisticated (this was a project done by secondary school students after all...)  
      More rigorous tools of analysis could've been used, such as:
    - Linear regression to find the degree of accuracy of the proposed relationship.
    - Hypothesis testing could also have been used to validate the degree of accuracy of our results.
